# Pyret-Parser-Interpreter
A Pyret Parser and Interpreter I made for my Organization of Programming Languages class.

This is an interpreter and parser that I wrote for my Organization of Programming Languages class. It contains support for values, booleans, strings, binary expressions, unary expressions, letx expressions, and conditional statements.

This was originally an assignment given by John Dolan, and the test cases and abstract syntax are created by him. This is uploaded here without Professor Dolan's permission. If you want this taken down, please contact me and I will remove it.
